My first attempt to make a project from my make_a_canvas_program idea.
This is an attempt at making a simple paint program. I don't know how 
far I'll go... it's mainly for practice with the canvas API and web-dev.

Some ideas:
-start by making it write and erase properly with left and right mouse clicks
-make a palette to change colors and tool tip size/shape
-make the canvas variable size
-make artwork savable/loadable
-make tools: pencil, wallpaper, zoom, cut, copy, paste, mini-view
-maybe layers
