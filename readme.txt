After I learned some basic canvas API, I switched to this computer and tried to
build from memory an HTML, CSS, JavaScript system that would present a canvas that did the 
most basic stuff... An interactive canvas program starter! I think I made a fairly
streamlined beginning to many possible projects.
I can imagine using this to start making a paint program, or fractal program, or a video game...
Who knows! But, its a good starter to practice web-dev, graphics, and programming in general.
Now, go forth and multiply!
